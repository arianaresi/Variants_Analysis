This repository contains scripts and documentation for analyzing genetic variants from exome sequencing data. It includes steps for quality filtering and prioritization of variants potentially associated with Mendelian diseases.

I recommend reading the paper made up for the course to understand the biological context of this bioinformatic project.

In the same way, we wrote the following [abstract](https://github.com/arianaresi/RNA-seq-Project/tree/main/Abstract) of our project.
